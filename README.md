# 🚦 Traffic Flow Optimization

## 📌 Overview
Traffic congestion is a major urban challenge. This project leverages **AI-powered traffic prediction**, **IoT data integration**, and **data encryption** to enhance road efficiency and provide real-time traffic analysis.

## 🔥 Features
- **AI Traffic Prediction**: Uses a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict traffic conditions.
- **IoT Data Simulation**: Generates real-time traffic data including vehicle count, speed, and signal status.
- **Data Encryption**: Implements **Fernet encryption** to secure transmitted data.
- **Interactive Chatbot**: Enables users to **predict traffic conditions** using hour, weather, and event inputs.

## ⚙️ Installation
### Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas sklearn cryptography
